How the deckcode works:

The code is broken down into asci integers, then those integers are turned into binary. 

We start at number 48 and end at 111, giving us 6 binary digits to work with (though there would be more available, this is all we got for now).

Take, for example, the deck code 90no

We can get all of the cards digit by digit:
Starting with 9, we turn it into the ascii 57. Because we start at 48, we can subtract 48 to give us 9.

9, into binary is 001001 (note, we turn it into 6 binary digits, two zeros in front)

This binary code can be broken up into pairs of two: 00-10-01
Each pair represents a card. The least significant pair of the code, is card ID 1. The second least significant is card id 2.

(this means it kind of flips)
Therefore: 9 = 00-10-01 = 0-2-1 = 1 of Card1, 2 of Card2, 0 of Card3

We apply the same rules going forward. So next with 0:
0 = 00-00-00 = 0-0-0 = 0 Card4, 0 Card5, 0 Card6.

Moving on to the next digit, n:
n = 110 in ascii
We subtract 48, so 
n = 62

62 = 111110 = 11-11-01 = 1 of Card7, 3 of Card8, 2 of Card9 

It will later be modified to not waste so many bits.
